# Applied Linear Algebra in Neural Network Design and Optimization

This project explores the application of linear algebra in the design and optimization of neural networks. It includes implementations of matrix transformations and a basic neural network model, showcasing how fundamental mathematical concepts can enhance machine learning models' efficiency and accuracy.

# Matrix Transformations and Neural Networks: A Practical Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed project where I have explored the intersection of linear algebra and neural networks. The project is divided into two primary sections:

1. **Matrix Transformations:** In this section, I implemented various linear transformations, such as scaling, reflection, shear, and rotation, using matrix operations. These transformations form the foundation of many machine learning algorithms and geometric manipulations in computer vision.

2. **Neural Networks:** Here, I developed a simple neural network model from scratch. The focus was on understanding and implementing forward propagation, cost function optimization, and parameter updates using gradient descent. By applying linear algebra principles, the neural network was able to efficiently process input data and generate predictions.

## Project Structure
- `Matrix Transformations`: Contains the implementation of various linear transformations.
- `Neural Network Model`: Includes the development of a basic neural network, focusing on understanding forward propagation and cost function computation.
- `Exercises`: Practical exercises are integrated throughout the project to reinforce the concepts.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Implementation:** The project covers essential linear transformations and their application in neural networks.
- **Hands-On Coding:** Every concept is backed by Python code, demonstrating the practical application of theoretical principles.
- **Clear Documentation:** Each section is well-documented, explaining the purpose, methodology, and results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language used for implementing the algorithms and models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.
